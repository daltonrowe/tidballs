Jason Gregory got me and Tid in this 9 month bowling league to cure our boredom and depression while my girlfriend (now wife) basically supported me for about a month. Jason said "We gotta open a bar!!! You boys are the hot thing in this town and I play with every musician in BG. We just need a place and I know where one is." I was game, tired of feeling useless, and I hated the bowling alley. I had tried earlier that day to get a gig at Mariah's in the bar. Their bar manager blew me off and had no interest in me. Anybody been there lately? Lol, schmuck.

After seeing the old Parakeet spot, it wasn't ideal. The last tenant left it in rough shape, it needed love and a lot of it!!! Kenny Lee told me two things a venue must have was a good location and plenty of parking. JACKPOT!!!!! Plus, Jason was right. We had the hot hand! Everyone wanted to hang out with us and our crew...every...single...night!!!! Fuck it, let's do it. We put all of our $$$ together and took a chance on ourselves. OK, "Where do we sign Mr. Baker."

We had to assemble a staff. Bartenders? Easy, me and Tid in our prime were knocking out crowds of 300 no problem and if money was going home it was gonna be in our pockets. (Any other bartenders, we'll get someone in here and train on the job.) Jeff Walker, Brown, Rog, Meares, Losson,Greer, Bucky. That's our crew, but we gotta have Jeff, Brown, and Rog. They were a must!!!

Brown moved to Tennessee soon after we opened. He helped us every day to get the place ready..

Jeff. Wow!!!! From beginning to end, what has he not done. That odd shaped bar I wanted that has seen THOUSANDS of customers, dollars, spills, and drinks? Jeff built it! Jeff has done everything we asked of him, and if he didn't It was a shitty idea. Jeff is not a bouncer, security, or an employee. Jeff is our friend and our brother and we love him. I know none of this is possible without him. His loyalty and dedication is unmatched. I love ya Jeff.

Rog is the yin to Jeff's yang, Batman and Robin, Good Cop and Bad Cop. A beast of man with the heart of a child, maybe one the nicest people you will ever meet. He may be a few minutes late time to time, but not "Jeff late". HaHaHa! He's also done everything ever asked of him. Rog is our brother. We will always be here for our brothers. Love you Rog.

Working with these two on a full capacity night while Tid spoke in broken sentences is as well oiled a machine can possibly get. I miss those nights and the teamwork. Ill never experience it again, but thank God I did.
