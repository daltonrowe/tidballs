We've been through a lot of door help from the days of Losson, Greer, and Bucky splitting a shift and $30 because they had tummy aches (wink, wink) (it's probably best I don't share their reoccurring symptoms) to Lee Harvey taking naps to Byron, to Titus, to Higgy, to Justin, to many I've forgotten about. All were valuable...some more than others. Every now and then they would become projects, bartender projects. Lee Harvey, Night Train Wayne, and Losson did well with the transition, but didn't last due to other adventures in life. Lee Harvey to this day is still my favorite songwriter in BG.

There are 3 diamonds in the rough that come to mind. Jim "Swells", Kenny, and Beckley. Jim was close to being legit but left for greener pastures. He was always there regardless of the night or time, but we had to endure talks of childish TV shows and shitty music. Still love the guy dearly and miss him being around.

Kenny along with Marshall and Beckley is probably the most enjoyable of the imports I've worked with. What am I saying? You the funnest person I know. We still share Tidballâ€™s stories weekly and those legendary tales will remain between us and the rest of the family. He's one of our best friends to this day, our kids love him, we vacation together, you name it. He's the best and one of those people who has made the journey worth it! Damn, we had too much fun. Love ya bub.

Beckley.... I wasn't a fan, didn't want him working here. He was rude, foul mouthed, didn't take shit off people, always throwing people out, but was a machine behind the bar and at any task given. His attitude at times was just plain shitty, but he makes shit happen and at times carried the team. There was something about him...I got it!!! He was basically a tall skinny me with chops and cooler. We ain't perfect, but we gonna be the first person you go to when you need something. He's still there and basically took my place. Like Kenny, he is now one of my best friends and has taken care of things during all my absences. Thanks DJ Whatcha Mama Say. I appreciate the hell outta you. I was wrong about you from the beginning, dead wrong. My brother till the end.
