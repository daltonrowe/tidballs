Aside from the head bartender or bar owner, no one controls the room or your night any more than the sound technician. Dear God, the equipment is expensive. We've blown through more equipment than the city does money on worthless additions and expenditures to our community. (We still waiting on a repair of a brick sidewalk they busted all to hell digging a trench right outside our front door during the great downtown paving monstrosity) PA's, monitors, amps, mains, subs, XLR cables, mics, (let's throw lighting costs in there too) the list goes on and on and on!!

Contrary to popular belief, sound techs are not a dime a dozen and a lot of em just suck. Once you find one, you better treat them right!!

Loud is not good! There has to be an understanding of the room, the band, the crowd, and an appreciation and respect for the thousands of $$$ at your fingertips. Each person on stage must hear themselves while subs artfully rattle windows and every note echoes from brick to brick in a small room. It's a hard room to master, but when Jake, Curtis, Jared, Jay, Troy, Colton, Barlow or the legendary Brian White are at the helm It becomes magic!!!! There's no other room like it. I'm not being bias just blatantly honest. Like Billy Swayze said, "It's where everyone goes to show their cards."

These gentlemen are all accomplished and amazing musicians. The talent they possess is that of a dream team. If you guys see this, John and I know how valuable you have been. Many times you go unnoticed or unrecognized. Not here, not by these local bands. You are the maestro to Bowling Green's soundtrack for the last 25 years. You deserve an ovation.
We come a long way from an 8 channel board being secretly untweeked (that's not a word) by Jason Gregory in 2002 with a hospitable and courteous recognition of "Welcome to the stage Mother Fu\*ker" as you have no earthly clue what you may sound like.
